Construct a basic particle filter with three steps: predict, reweight, and resample.

In the second constructor, `model` is used for both the prediction and reweighting.

"""
    predict!(pm, m, b, u, rng)
    predict!(pm, m, b, u, y, rng)

Fill `pm` with predicted particles for the next time step.

A method of this function should be implemented by prediction models to be used in a [`BasicParticleFilter`](@ref). `pm` should be a correctly-sized vector created by [`particle_memory`](@ref) to hold a one-step-propagated particle for each particle in `b`.

Normally the observation `y` is not needed, so most prediction models should implement the first version, but the second is available for heuristics that use `y`.

# Arguments
- `pm::Vector`: memory for holding the propagated particles; created by [`particle_memory`](@ref) and resized to `n_particles(b)`.
- `m`: prediction model, the "owner" of this function
- `b::ParticleCollection`: current belief; each particle in this belief should be propagated one step and inserted into `pm`.
- `u`: control or action
- `rng::AbstractRNG`: random number generator; should be used for any randomness in propagation for reproducibility.
- `y`: measuerement/observation (usually not needed)

# Arguments
- `wm::Vector{Float64}`: memory for holding likelihood weights.
- `m`: reweighting model, the "owner" of this function
- `b::ParticleCollection`: previous belief; `pm` should contain a propagated particle for each particle in this belief
- `u`: control or action
- `pm::Vector`: memory for holding current particles; these particle have been propagated by `predict!`.
- `y`: measurement/observation
- `rng::AbstractRNG`: random number generator; should be used for any randomness for reproducibility.
