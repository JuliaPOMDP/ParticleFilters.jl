    "text": "The basic particle filtering step in ParticleFilters.jl is implemented in the update function, and consists of three steps:Prediction (or propagation) - each state particle is simulated forward one step in time\nReweighting - an explicit measurement (observation) model is used to calculate a new weight\nResampling - a new collection of state particles is generated with particle frequencies proportional to the new weightsThis is an example of sequential importance resampling, and the SIRParticleFilter constructor can be used to construct such a filter with a model that controls the prediction and reweighting steps, and a number of particles to create in the resampling phase.A more flexible structure for building a particle filter is the BasicParticleFilter. It contains three models, one for each step:The predict_model controls prediction through predict!\nThe reweight_model controls reweighting through reweight!\nThe resampler controls resampling through resampleParticleFilters.jl contains implementations of these components that can be mixed and matched. In many cases the prediction and reweighting steps use the same model, for example a ParticleFilterModel or a POMDP.To carry out the steps individually without the need for pre-allocating memory or doing a full update step, the predict, reweight, and resample functions are provided."

    "text": "Many of the most common problems with particle filters are related to particle depletion, that is, a lack of particles corresponding to the true state. In many cases, it is not difficult to overcome these problems, but domain-specific heuristics are often more effective than generic approaches.The recommended first remedy for particle depletion is to write a custom domain-specific resampler that injects new appropriate particles in the case of particle depletion. The particle depletion can be detected by observing low likelihood weights and handling it within the resample function.The example below contains a more robust resampler for POMDP models. When it detects a complete particle depletion with weight_sum(bp) == 0.0, it replaces the particles by sampling from the initial state distribution.using POMDPs\nusing ParticleFilters\n\nstruct POMDPResampler\n    n::Int\nend\n\nfunction ParticleFilters.resample(r::POMDPResampler,\n                                  bp::WeightedParticleBelief,\n                                  pm::POMDP,\n                                  rm::POMDP,\n                                  b,\n                                  a,\n                                  o,\n                                  rng)\n\n    if weight_sum(bp) == 0.0\n        # no appropriate particles - resample from the initial distribution\n        new_ps = [initialstate(pm, rng) for i in 1:r.n]\n        return ParticleCollection(new_ps)\n    else\n        # normal resample\n        return resample(LowVarianceResampler(r.n), bp, rng)\n    end\nendIf it is not possible to handle particle depletions only within resample, then it may be possible to handle with a custom prediction or reweighting model, or it may be best to write a new filter using the building blocks in this package. A good way to get started on this is to look at the implementation of the update function of the BasicParticleFilter"

This package provides O(n) resamplers.Dynamics and measurement models for the filters can be specified as a ParticleFilterModel or a POMDP or a custom user-defined type.The simplest sequential-importance-resampling Particle filter can be constructed with SIRParticleFilter. BasicParticleFilter provides a more flexible structure.Basic setup of a model is as follows:using ParticleFilters, Distributions\n\ndynamics(x, u, rng) = x + u + randn(rng)\ny_likelihood(x_previous, u, x, y) = pdf(Normal(), y - x)\nmodel = ParticleFilterModel{Float64}(dynamics, y_likelihood)\npf = SIRParticleFilter(model, 10)Then the update function can be used to perform a particle filter update.b = ParticleCollection([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\nu = 1.0\ny = 3.0\n\nb_new = update(pf, b, u, y)There are tutorials for three ways to use the particle filters:As an estimator for feedback control,\nto filter time-series measurements, and\nas an updater for POMDPs.jl.For documentation on all aspects of the package, see the contents below."

The first parameter of the type, S, specifies the state type. The constructor arguments are two functions. The first, f, is the dynamics function, which produces the next state given the current state, control, and a random number generator as arguments. The second function, g is describes the weight that should be given to the particle given the original state, control, final state, and observation as arguments.

This algorithm is implemented by the LowVarianceResampler.
